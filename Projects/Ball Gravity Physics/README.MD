# Ball Gravity Physics

A simple physics simulation of balls that have a certan a gravitational force to a point, in this case the mouse position.  

Does have support for multiple effectors (gravity points) but at the moment its just the mouse position.  

I am planning on rewriting the whole thing so it also takes mass into account and optimizing it.  
Might make a wasm version of it too to learn how to do that.
