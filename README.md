# WEB-TOMFOOLERY

This repo mainly consists of some small web-demo's of simulations or random things i thought of or interested me or just tests.  

Feel free to use anything i made in this repo.  

note: most of what i made here are made in short impulses of inspiration and might not be made to any standard worth copy-pasting.
